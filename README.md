## Overview

This repository presents the implementation and analysis of **search algorithms applied to the Pacman problem**.  
The study focuses on modeling the problem space, defining transition operators, and implementing traversal algorithms using **Python**, with emphasis on **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

The project combines **theoretical problem formulation** with **practical algorithmic implementation**.

## Installation & Run Guide

### Prerequisites

This project requires **Python 3** to be installed on your system.

Check that Python is available by running:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, download it from:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

### Install

Clone this repository to your local machine. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Artificial-Intelligence-aka-Uniwa/Search-Algorithms.git
``` 
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Search-Algorithms/src
```

### Run

Execute the program:
```bash
python pacman.py
```
or (depending on your system)
```bash
python3 pacman.py
```

When the program starts, you will be prompted to select a blind search algorithm:

```
DFS – Depth-First Search

BFS – Breadth-First Search
```

The chosen algorithm explores the state space of the Pacman problem using:

- Movement operators: up, down, left, right
- Fruit-eating operator
- Successor generation via the `find_children()` function

The search terminates when:

- A goal state (all fruits are eaten) is reached, or No valid solution exists

The solution path is displayed as a sequence of 2D grid states, printed step-by-step.
